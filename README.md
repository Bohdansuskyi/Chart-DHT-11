# DHT11 Sensor Data Transmission to Django REST API

This project demonstrates how to send data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor using a NodeMCU v3 board to a Django application deployed on PythonAnywhere. The Django REST Framework is utilized to facilitate the API communication.

#### Requirements
Django: 5.0.7
Django REST Framework: 3.15.2
django-filter: 24.2
Markdown: 3.6

### Features
1. Real-time data transmission from the DHT11 sensor (with delay).
2. RESTful API endpoints for data handling.
3. Easy integration with IoT devices using NodeMCU.
