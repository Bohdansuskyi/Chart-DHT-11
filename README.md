# IoT Project: NodeMCU v3 with DHT11 Sensor for Data Transmission to Django REST API

 This project demonstrates how to send data from a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor using a NodeMCU v3 board to a Django application deployed on PythonAnywhere. The Django REST Framework is used to simplify API communication. Temperature and humidity data are also displayed using graphs (chart.js).

### Requirements
- Django: 5.0.7
- Django REST Framework: 3.15.2
- django-filter: 24.2
- Markdown: 3.6
- Python 3.12.3
You may use another version, but it is recommended to use Python 3.9 and newer.

### Features
1. Real-time data transmission from the DHT11 sensor (with delay).
2. RESTful API endpoints for data handling.
3. Easy integration with IoT devices using NodeMCU.
